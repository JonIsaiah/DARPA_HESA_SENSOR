# DARPA_HESA_Sensor

This code constitutes the firmware for the wireless IMU sensor nodes (version 1) for exoskeleton motion capture and other motion capture applications.

Data is read from the accelerometer, passed through a sensor fusion algorithm (complimentary filter in this case) and then sent to the central receiver.

To Dos:

  Add some method of sensor synchronization and time stamps to sensor data *Will require hardware changes*
